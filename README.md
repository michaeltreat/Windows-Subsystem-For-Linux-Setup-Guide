The Windows Subsystem for Linux feature on Windows 10 enables users to have a Linux enviroment fully integrated into their Windows PC.

For ~~experienced~~ all developers: This is not a VM, a Dual-boot, or a console wrapper like Git Bash or Cygwin. It is a native POSIX environment directly mounted to your Windows File System.

### Video Guide: 

This guide also has a video walkthrough of it on YouTube where it goes into great detail on each section to help provide you with as much context as possible.
